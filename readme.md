# Quiz Examination Application

This is a simple Online Quiz examination application.

* I have used laravel in the whole project.
* For databases, I have used MySQL.
* For frontend, I have used html and css.
* Here I have created --REST API-- endpoints to create and get questions.

Firstly, You need to Register and Login in the project. Then You have seen a window with two buttons Teacher and Student.
If you want to create, modify or delete questions then you have to select the Teacher button.
And if you want to participate in the test, then you have to select the Student button and start the quiz. After finishing the test, you can see your result on the screen.

You can also get here the API endpoints to create and get questions using the links-
* For creating question: <server_link/api/add-question>
* For getting question: <server_link/api/question>
